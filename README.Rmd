### icesDatsuQC

Run quality checks on data sets using the same checks that are conducted on the [ICES Data Submission Utility (DATSU)](https://datsu.ices.dk/web/index.aspx).

icesDatsuQC is implemented as an [R](https://www.r-project.org) package and
is currently hosted on [r-universe](https://ices-tools-prod.r-universe.dev)
and available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=icesDatsuQC).

### Installation

The stable version of icesDatsuQC can be installed from CRAN using the `install.packages` command:

```r
install.packages("icesDatsuQC", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
```

or a potentially more recent, but less stable version installed from r-universe:

```r
install.packages("icesDatsuQC", repos = "https://ices-tools-prod.r-universe.dev")
```

### Usage

For a summary of the package:

```r
library(icesDatsuQC)
?icesDatsuQC
```

### Examples

#### Test a VMS data file

A sample data file is included with the icesDatsu package called vms_test.csv
```{r}
library(icesDatsuQC)
filename <- system.file("test_files/vms_test.csv", package = "icesDatsuQC")
vms_test <- read.csv(filename, header = FALSE)
head(vms_test)
```

Lets say we have used the `icesDatsu` package to find the correct dataset version ID and
record ID, that is, we know we want dataset 145 (VMS) and record type VE (VMS records).

Then to run the SQL checks on our file, run:

```{r}
runQCChecks(filename, 145, "VE")
```

So all checks passed. Great, what is it like if there is an error? Lets force an error

```{r}
# invalid year
vms_test[1:2, 3] <- 1999
# invalid month
vms_test[3, 4] <- 13
# invalid discinct vessel count
vms_test[3, 5] <- 0
# invalid country code - only one country per file MISSED
vms_test[3, 2] <- "NO"
write.table(vms_test, file = "vms_test2.csv", row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE, sep = ",")
runQCChecks("vms_test2.csv", 145, "VE")
```
